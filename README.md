# hello-world
This is my first git hub repo!


I am trying to learn a little about version control for software development, branches and general best practices. I am a novist hobbyist when it comes to coding, mainly learning to support my interaction with developers in my normal day to day job as a BA. I code on an Ubuntu desktop, and am using Python's Django framework with POSTGRESQL for my DB.
